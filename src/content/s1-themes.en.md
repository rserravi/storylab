# Universal Themes (and opposites)

> **Note:** No story relies on a single universal theme. Several themes will appear through different characters. The more themes present, the deeper the story; the most epic ones touch all five (or their opposites). The main plot focuses on one; the rest act as sub-themes.

---

## Love **|** Hate
**Love**: whether fulfilled or unrequited, it powers epics and intimate tales alike.  
Examples: *Beauty and the Beast*, *Cyrano de Bergerac*, *King Kong*, *Casablanca*.

**Hate / Anti-Love** (vengeance) often intertwines with love.  
Example: *Kill Bill*.

---

## Messiah (The Chosen) **|** Villain (The Enemy)
**Messiah**: a chosen figure who mirrors our ideals and ultimately saves us.  
Examples: *Gandhi*, *Superman* (any superhero), *Spartacus*, *The Matrix*, *Star Wars*.

**Anti-Messiah / Villain**: someone “greater” than us, but evil.  
Examples: *The Silence of the Lambs*, *All About Eve*.

---

## Quest **|** Secret
**Quest**: protagonists pursuing an objective in a new world for them.  
Examples: *Jason and the Argonauts*, *The Odyssey*, *The Lord of the Rings*, *American Beauty*, *The Da Vinci Code*.

**Secret** (the opposite): protecting a secret at all costs; common in love triangles, comedies, or noir.  
Example: *Rope*.

---

## Damnation (Faust) **|** Freedom
**Damnation**: sacrificing soul/freedom/humanity for greater power.  
Examples: *The Godfather*, *Star Wars: Episode III*, *Dracula*, *Jekyll & Hyde*, *The Firm*, *The Devil’s Advocate*.

**Freedom**: releasing oneself from burden or oppression.  
Related notes: *Dracula* longs for rest; the Don in *The Godfather* tires of power; Faust regrets the pact. Variations: *Sid and Nancy*, *Thelma & Louise*.

---

## Deception **|** Truth
**Deception**: people or worlds are not what they seem (not the same as “keeping a secret”).  
Examples: *The Sixth Sense*, *The Others*, *Fight Club*, *A Beautiful Mind*, *American Psycho*, *Psycho*.

**Truth**: revealing what is real (not the same as “investigative truth”).  
Example: *JFK* (investigation).

## Case study: *The Matrix*
- **Messiah** — Neo, the Chosen One: **MAIN THEME**  
- **Quest** — Morpheus searches for the One  
- **Love** — Neo/Trinity  
- **Deception** — the Matrix itself  
- **Damnation** — the red pill: give up comfort for “the real”
