# Three-act structure (approx.)

![Three-act structure map](/assets/Estructura-guion.png)

**30m–60m–30m.**  
**ACT I** — **SETUP**. Establish **STYLE, RHYTHM, CHARACTERS, and SETTING**. Over ~30 pages, present the main characters and state the **DRAMATIC PREMISE** (what the film is about).

An **INCITING INCIDENT** kicks things off and leads to the **BREAK INTO ACT II** (first major decision), which propels the protagonist into the second act.

**ACT II** — **CONFRONTATION**, ~60 pages. Characters face obstacles and try to overcome them. Around the halfway point (~minute 60), we hit the **MIDPOINT / ORDEAL** — a maximum test or major event with **no way back**.

Consequences unfold until the **CRISIS** at the end of Act II: a turn that pushes the story into its resolution.

**ACT III** — **RESOLUTION**. The story is **solved**. The **CLIMAX** answers the main dramatic question raised by the crisis. Remaining questions should be resolved before the credits (sometimes a post-credits coda appears).

**Key plot points** to know before writing: **INCITING INCIDENT**, **BREAK INTO ACT II**, **MIDPOINT / ORDEAL**, **CRISIS**, and **CLIMAX**.
