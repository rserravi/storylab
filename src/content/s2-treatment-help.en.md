# How to Write a Treatment (quick guide)

A **treatment** tells your film **in prose** (no formal dialogue), clearly and visually. It aligns story and tone before the script.

## Length (rough)
- Feature: 3–8 pages.
- TV pilot: 2–5 pages.

## Purpose
- Explain **what happens and why it matters** (cause → effect).
- Show the **protagonist’s arc** and **dramatic need**.
- Convey **tone/style** and **genre**.

## Helpful structure
1. **H1: Logline & premise** — 2–3 sentences.
2. **H2: Act I — Setup** — ordinary world, inciting incident, **break into Act II**.
3. **H2: Act II — Confrontation** — rising obstacles, **midpoint/ordeal**, consequences.
4. **H2: Act III — Resolution** — **crisis**, **climax**, new normal.

## Style
- Present tense, **active verbs**, concrete images.
- **Bold** for milestones, *italics* for emphasis, and _underline_ sparingly.
- Avoid long dialogue: 1–2 lines only when **essential**.

## Tips
- Every paragraph should **move the story**.
- Always ask **why**: motivation → decision → consequence.
- If stuck, write the **ending** first and backtrack.

> A good treatment stands alone and makes you eager to read the script.
