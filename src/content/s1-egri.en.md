# S1 — Ideation (Egri): Idea, Premise, Theme

**Lajos Egri** suggests starting from a **Premise** formulated as a **causal proposition** that the script will *prove*:
> Trait/Cause → action/decision → consequence  
E.g.: *Unchecked ambition leads to self-destruction.*

## Steps
1. **Idea** — a brief sentence that hints at era/setting and sparks the story.
2. **Premise (proposition)** — a concise, testable claim about cause and effect.
3. **Main Theme** — pick one of the universal pairs (or the opposite):  
   Love/Hate, Messiah/Villain, Quest/Secret, Damnation/Freedom, Deception/Truth.
4. **Genre** — guides tone and audience expectations.

**Tip:** Make sure your Premise can be **demonstrated dramatically** through conflict and change.
